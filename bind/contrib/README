this directory is full of tools and examples that various individual
contributors have sent in.  most of them are actually in live production
use somewhere, though they are not of "publication" quality which is 
why they are here instead of in comp.sources.unix.  most of them are
not documented other than with comments in the sources.  all of them
are fairly clever.

use at your own risk.  neither the U C Regents or Digital Equipment
Corporation asserts compilation copyright on any of the works in this
directory; copyright, if any, rests with the contributors whose names appear
in the source files.  no warrantee is expressed or implied by the U C
Regents or Digital Equipment Corporation.  void where prohibited by law.
contents may have settled during shipping.

some useful looking utilities are not included here due to licensing issues:

-> http://sourceforge.net/projects/probind/

	ProBIND is a web application for administrating one or more BIND
	servers. It is intended for small to medium sized ISPs, but there is
	no reason why it couldn't be used wherever many zones must be managed
	across a set of master and slave servers.
