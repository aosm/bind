 * Read the contents of the given map file and create a context for mapping.
 *
 * 'file' is the pathname of the file, which specifies the character
 * mapping.  The file is a simple text file, and each line specifies
 * a mapping of a single character.  The format of each line is
 *
 *   <code_point>; [<code_point>..][;]
 *
 * where <code_point> is a UCS code point represented as a hexadecimal
 * string with optional prefix `U+' (ex. `0041' or `U+FEDC').
 * The code point before the first semicolon will be mapped to the
 * sequence of code points separated by space characters after the
 * first semicolon.  The sequence may be empty, denoting wiping out
 * the character.
 *
 * For example,
 *	U+0041; U+0061		-- maps 'A' to 'a'
 *	20;;			-- wipes out ' '
 *	
 * Anything after the second semicolon is ignored.  Also lines beginning
 * with '#' are treated as comments.
 *
 * If there is no error, the created context is stored in '*ctxp'.
 * 
 * Returns:
 *	mdn_success		-- ok.
 *	mdn_nofile		-- cannot open the specified file.
 *	mdn_nomemory		-- malloc failed.
 *	mdn_invalid_syntax	-- file format is not valid.
