 * Resolver library support.

 * All the functions provided by this module requires MDN resolver
 * configuration context of type 'mdn_resconf_t' as an argument.
 * This context holds information described in the configuration file
 * (mdnres.conf).  See mdn_resconf module for details.
 *
 * All functions also accept NULL as the context, but since
 * no conversion/normalization will be done in this case, it is

/*
 * Convert and check the string.
 *
 * This function converts the string `from' to `to', checks `from' or
 * combination of them, using `insn'.
 *
 * `insn' is a sequence of characters as follows:
 *
 *	l	convert the local codeset string to UTF-8.
 *	L	convert the UTF-8 string to the local codeset.
 *	d	perform local delimiter mapping.
 *	M	perfrom TLD based local mapping.
 *	m	perform the nameprep mapping.
 *	n	perform nameprep normalization.
 *	p	check whether the string contains nameprep prohibited
 *		character.
 *	N	equivalent to "mnp".
 *	u	check whether the string contains nameprep unassigned
 *		codepoint.
 *	I	convert the UTF-8 string to ACE.
 *	i	convert the ACE string to UTF-8.
 *	!m	inspect if nameprep mapping has been performed to the
 *		string.  If hasn't, convert the string to ACE.
 *	!n	inspect if nameprep normalizaion has been performed
 *		to the string.  If hasn't, convert the string to ACE.
 *	!p	search the string for nameprep prohibited character.
 *		If found, convert the string to ACE.
 *	!N	equivalent to "!m!n!p".
 *	!u	search the string for nameprep unassigned codepoint.
 *		If found, convert the string to ACE.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	mdn_success		-- ok.
 *	mdn_buffer_overflow	-- output buffer is too small.
 *	mdn_invalid_encoding	-- input string has invalid byte sequence.
 *	mdn_invalid_name	-- local encoding (codeset) name is invalid.
 *	mdn_invalid_action	-- `insn' contains invalid action.
 *	mdn_invalid_nomemory	-- out of memory.
 *	mdn_invalid_nomapping	-- no mapping to output codeset.
 *	mdn_prohibited		-- input string has a prohibited character.
 *	mdn_failure		-- other failure.
