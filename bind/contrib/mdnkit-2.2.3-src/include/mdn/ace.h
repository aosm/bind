 * Utility for ACE converter.
 *
 * Convert a domain name given by 'from' and stores the result to
 * 'to', whose length is 'tolen'.  If 'dir' is 'mdn_convert_u2l',
 * 'from' points UTF-8 string which is converted to ACE encoding.  If
 * 'dir' is 'mdn_convert_l2u', 'from' points ACE string which is
 * converted to UTF-8.
 * This function first breaks down the given name into labels,
 * and encode/decode each label.  When encoding, conversion of
 * STD13 conforming labels (i.e. valid ASCII labels) is skipped.
 * When decoding, if the decoding failed but the label is a legitimate
 * ASCII label, those labels are copied verbatim.  To reject illegally
 * encoded labels, the decoding process performs two kinds of checks:
 *  1. check that the decoded string does NOT comform to STD13.
 *  2. try encoding the decoded string, and see if the result matches
 *     to the original string.
