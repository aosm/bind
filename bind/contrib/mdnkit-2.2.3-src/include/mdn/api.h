/*
 * Encode multilingual domain name for name resolution.
 *
 * The encoding process consists of the following 5 steps.
 *
 *    1. local encoding (such as Shift-JIS or Big5) to UTF-8 conversion.
 *    2. delimiter mapping, which maps certain characters to period
 *       (U+002E, FULL STOP) character.
 *    3. non-standard local mapping, whose exact rule is determined by
 *       the TLD of the domain name to be encoded.  This allows
 *	 locale-specific mapping for each ccTLD.
 *    4. NAMEPREP, as described in the Internet Draft
 *       (draft-ietf-idn-nameprep-XX).  This step has an option of
 *       prohibiting use of unassigned code points in the domain name.
 *    5. UTF-8 to IDN encoding (ACE) conversion.
 *
 * Some steps can be skipped according to the application's needs.
 * For example, if the application holds the multilingual domain names in
 * UTF-8, step 1 above won't be necessary.
 *
 * 'actions' specifies what actions to take when encoding, and is
 * a bitwise-or of the following flags:
 *
 *   MDN_LOCALCONV	-- perform local encoding to UTF-8 conversion (step 1)
 *   MDN_DELIMMAP	-- perform delimiter mapping (step 2)
 *   MDN_LOCALMAP	-- perform local mapping (step 3)
 *   MDN_NAMEPREP       -- perform NAMEPREP (step 4)
 *   MDN_UNASCHECK	-- perform optional unassigned codepoint check
 *			   (also step 4)
 *   MDN_IDNCONV	-- perform UTF-8 to IDN encoding conversion (step 5)
 *
 * Note that if no flags are specified, 'mdn_encodename' does nothing
 * fancy, just copies the given name verbatim.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	mdn_success		-- ok.
 *	mdn_invalid_action	-- invalid action flag specified.
 *	mdn_invalid_encoding	-- the given string has invalid/illegal
 *				   byte sequence.
 *	mdn_prohibited		-- prohibited/unassigned code point found.
 *	mdn_buffer_overflow	-- 'tolen' is too small.
 *	mdn_nomemory		-- malloc failed.
 *
 * Also, if this function is called without calling 'mdn_nameinit',
 * the following error codes might be returned.
 *	mdn_nofile		-- cannot open the configuration file.
 *	mdn_invalid_syntax	-- syntax error found in the file.
 *	mdn_invalid_name	-- there are invalid names (encoding,
