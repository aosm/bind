 * Read the contents of the given file and create a context for
 * checking.
 *
 * 'file' is the pathname of the file, which specifies the set of
 * characters to be checked.  The file is a simple text file, and
 * each line must be of the form either
 *   <code_point>
 * or
 *   <code_point>-<code_point>
 * (or comment, see below) where <code_point> is a UCS code point
 * represented as hexadecimal string with optional prefix `U+'
 * (ex. `0041' or `U+FEDC').
 *
 * The former specifies just one character (a code point, to be precise),
 * while the latter specified a range of characters.  In the case of
 * a character range, the first code point (before hyphen) must not be
 * greater than the second code point (after hyphen).
 *
 * Lines starting with `#' are comments.
 *
 * If file is read with no errors, the created context is stored in
 * '*ctxp', and 'mdn_success' is returned.  Otherwise, the contents
 * of '*ctxp' is undefined.
 *
 * Returns:
 *	mdn_success		-- ok.
 *	mdn_nofile		-- cannot open the specified file.
 *	mdn_nomemory		-- malloc failed.
 *	mdn_invalid_syntax	-- file format is not valid.
