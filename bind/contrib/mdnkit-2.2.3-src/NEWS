Major changes in version 2.2.3:

* BIND-9 patch for BIND-9.2.0 is available.

* NAMEPREP draft -06 is supported.

* Problems on Tru64 are fixed.

Major changes in version 2.2.2:

* Now runmdn can work on NetBSD-1.5 or later.

Major changes in version 2.2.1:

* Fix a bug that the MDN library misses prohibited characters.

Major changes in version 2.2:

* Alternate encoding is no longer supported. 
  mDNkit now follows IDNA-03 which says in the section 2.1.2 that An
  IDNA-aware application MUST NOT do any preparation or conversion to
  ACE on any non-internationalized name part.  `alternate-encoding'
  entry in configuration file is simply ignored.

* The MDN library (libmdn) performs NAMEPREP check at decoding an ACE
  name.  If the name is not NAMEPREPed, libmdn returns a name with ACE
  encoding instead of local encoding.

* Supported ACEs are now AMC-ACE-Z, RACE and DUDE only.
  Since the IDN working group has chosen AMC-ACE-Z, most of other ACEs
  are no longer supported by default.  If you wanted to use those
  ACEs, specify `--enable-extra-ace' option of configure.

* mdnsproxy can output log messages to standard error.

* mdnsproxy adds date and time string to a message logged to a regular
  file.

* `--with-iconv-include', `--with-libiconv' and `--enable-debug'
  options are added to `configure'.

* `--with-libiconv' option is also added to `configure' in BIND-9 patch.

* A build problem on Linux with glibc-2.2 is fixed.

* The base version of BIND-9 patch is now 9.1.3.

* Supported NAMEPREP drafts are -03 and -05.
  -02 and -04 are not supported.

* `-e' option is added to runmdn to set local encoding.

* `dig', `host' and `nslookup' of BIND-9 with MDN support patch
  recognize the MDN_DISABLE environment variable.  Those commands turn
  off MDN support if the variable is defined.

Major changes in version 2.1:

* BIND-9 patch is back.  The patch adds encoding conversion and
  NAMEPREP capability to `dig', `host' and `nslookup'.
  Since mDNkit version 2 adopts IDNA, in which all the MDN processing
  are performed in the application layer before calling the resolver
  layer, the patch no longer contains modification of the light-weight
  resolver or `allow-utf8' extension of `named' configuration syntax
  found in mDNkit version 1.x.

* Runmdn is back.  The strategy for making resolver MDN-aware has been
  changed from replacing low-level resolver functions to wrapping
  resolver API functions, so that it should also work for exotic
  resolver implementations such as Solaris's.

* Several new ACEs are supported.  These are `AltDUDE', `AMC-ACE-M',
  `AMC-ACE-O' and  `AMC-ACE-R'.

* `-version' option is added to mdnconv and mdnsproxy.  When the option
  is specified, the command prints its version number and exits
  immediately.

* For some of frequently used options, single-character short-cut options
  are provided for mdnconv.

* The base versions of Squid patch is now 2.4.STABLE1.

* A build problem on NetBSD 1.5 is fixed.


Major changes in version 2.0.1:

* A bug in mdnsproxy/Makefile.in is fixed.  Now mdnsproxy 2.X can be
  built on Solaris.


Major changes in version 2.0:

* The MDN library (libmdn) performs domain name preparation (NAMEPREP)
  according to the current Internet Draft.  Currently nameprep-02 and
  nameprep-03 are supported.  Also additional local name preparation
  can be performed before NAMEPREP.  Along with this change, command
  line options of `mdnconv' are greatly changed.  See the man page
  mdnconv(1) for more details.

* mDNkit adopts IDNA, which is an architecture for handling
  multilingual domain names currently being discussed at IETF IDN
  working group.  MDN library provides new API in accordance with this
  IDNA, and NAMEPREP.

* The default configuration file name for the MDN Library is changed
  from `mdnres.conf' to `mdn.conf'.  Note that syntax of the file has
  some incompatible changes.  See the man page mdn.conf(5).

* dnsproxy is renamed to `mdnsproxy'.  The default configuration file
  is also renamed from `dnsproxy.conf' to `mdnsproxy.conf', and its
  syntax is revised.  Unlike dnsproxy which only reads `dnsproxy.conf',
  mdnsproxy also reads mdn.conf.  The path name of `mdn.conf' can be
  specified in mdnsproxy.conf.  See mdnsproxy.conf(5) for more details.

* For security reason, default directory where mdnsproxy outputs log
  files is moved from `/tmp' to `/var/log/mdnsproxy'.  `--with-logdir'
  option to configure can customize the directory location.

* mdnsproxy can output log messages with syslog.

* DUDE converter is revised and now conforms to -01 draft.

* This release doesn't contain runmdn and bind9 patch.  They are
  expected to appear again in future versions.


Major changes in version 1.3:

* dnsproxy supports access control.  dnsproxy now recognizes
  `allow-access' and `log-on-denied' entries in a configuration file.
  See dnsproxy.8 and dnsproxy.conf.sample for more details.

* LACE converter incorporates numeral checks introduced by -01 draft.

* New encoding converters for `DUDE' and `UTF-6' are implemented.

* Whether a given name conforms the host name requirement in STD13 or
  not is checked more strictly by the MDN library.  A name starting
  or ending with hypen is not considered as STD13 conformed name, even
  if the name consists exclusively of alphabets, digits and hypens.
  
* The base versions of BIND-9 patch are now 9.0.1 and 9.1.0.

* The base versions of BIND-8 patch is now 8.2.3 only.


Major changes in version 1.2.1:

* RACE converter incorporates numeral checks introduced by -03 draft.
  Also a bug, which produces incorrectly encoded string (actually
  encoded in the way -00 draft specifies), is fixed.

* The base version of BIND-9 patch has changed from 9.0.0 to 9.0.1.

* The base versions of BIND-8 patch are now 8.2.2-P7 and 8.2.3-T9B.

* runmdn now works again.

* mdnconv is improved so that it can nicely convert ACE-encoded text
  to other encodings.  It detects ACE portions of the input string and
  converts only them, leaving non-ACE portions intact.  Previously
  only RACE had such capability, but now other ACEs also have this
  capability as long as they have certain prefix/suffix ("bq--" for
  RACE, for example).


Major changes in version 1.2:

* New encoding converters for `BRACE' and `LACE' are implemented.

* New normalize schemes `ja-compose-voiced-sound', 'ja-kana-fullwidth'
  and 'ja-alnum-halfwidth' introduced.

* mDN Wrapper is thoroughly overhauled.
  - Log level can be specified by using GUI (or directly editing the
    registry Software\JPNIC\MDN\LogLevel).  Note that fine grain
    control over logging is supported only by the MDN library (libmdn).
    Log output from mDN Wrapper itself can be turned on or off, but
    no log level support.
  - Log file can also specified.
  - Some serious bugs are fixed, including incorrect program-side
    encoding (codeset) detection.
  - Advanced configuration feature implemented.  Now DNS encoding and
    normalization can be customizable.  Also you can configure which
    winsock DLL to be wrapped.

* dnsproxy and mDN Wrapper now correctly accept and process client-
  supplied domain names encoded in the alternate encoding.  Previously
  worked correctly only when the alternate encoding happened to be the
  same as the server encoding.

* 8bit-through patch for BIND-8.2.2-P5 is replaced by a new patch
  for BIND-8.2.2-P7.

* A buffer overrun bug in RACE converter is fixed.


Major changes in version 1.1:

* Log level of dnsproxy can be specified with ``log-level'' entry.
  available levels are `none', `fatal', `warning' and `trace'.  See
  dnsproxy.8 or dnsproxy.conf.sample for details.

* Sending SIGHUP to dnsproxy causes it to close and re-open the log file.
  Useful for log file turnover.

* If log file is not specified, dnsproxy uses the default log file
  /tmp/dnsproxy.log.  Previously behavior was that no logging was done
  at all, conflicting with what document says.

* dnsproxy won't terminate even if recvfrom() returns unexpected
  errors such as `connection refused (ECONNREFUSED)'.  On Linux, it is
  reported that it sometimes returns this error even for
  connection-less (ie UDP) sockets.

* DNS message ID allocation/release bugs in dnsproxy are fixed.
  Previously dnsproxy seems to stop working if it receives more than
  4096 requests in 10 minutes.

* RACE conversion bug is fixed.  Previously, if the prefix part contains
  any uppercase letters (such as "Bq--"), it is not recognized as a
  RACE prefix.
