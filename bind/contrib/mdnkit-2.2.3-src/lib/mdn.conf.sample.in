# Sample file for mDNkit version 2 resolver configuration file (mdn.conf).

# [This file is tailored for preference "@preference@".]

#
# `idn-encoding' entry specifies the encoding name used as the encoding
# of multilingualized names by resolvers and DNS servers.  Currently, the
# following encodings are available:
#
#	AMC-ACE-Z
#	DUDE
#	RACE
#	UTF-8
#	<codeset names your iconv_open() accepts>
#
# syntax)

#
# `nameprep' entry specifies the version of NAMEPREP.
# mDNkit currently supports the following version:
#
#	nameprep-03		-- name preparation scheme described in the
#				   IETF draft `idn-nameprep-03'
#	nameprep-05		-- name preparation scheme described in the
#				   IETF draft `idn-nameprep-05'

#
# If both `nameprep' and more-specific entries (i.e. `nameprep-*' entries)
# are specified, more-specific ones take precedence.

#
# `nameprep-map' entry specifies the mapping scheme of NAMEPREP process.
# Avaialable mapping schemes are:
#
#	<nameprep version>	-- nameprep version
#	filemap:<pathname>	-- read mapping rules from a file
#
# syntax)
#	nameprep-map <scheme> ...

# If multiple schemes are specified, they are applied in turn.

# `nameprep-normalize' entry specifies the normalization scheme of NAMEPREP
# process.  Avaialable normalization schemes are:
#
#	<nameprep version>	-- nameprep version
#	unicode-form-kc		-- Unicode normalization form KC
#				   defined by the latest standard.
#	unicode-form-kc/3.0.1	-- Unicode normalization form KC

# `nameprep-prohibit' entry specifies the prohibited characters in the
# NAMEPREP process.  The following sets are recognized.
#
#	<nameprep version>	-- nameprep version
#	fileset:<pathname>	-- read definition from a file.
#
# syntax)
#	nameprep-prohibit <set> ...
#
# If multiple sets are specified, they are applied in turn.

# `local-map' entry specifies TLD (top level domain) based local mapping
# schemes, which is performed before NAMEPREP.  Available schemes of
# `local-map' are the same as those of the `nameprep-map' entry.
# 
# syntax)
#	local-map <tld> <scheme> ...
#
# If the TLD of the domain name matches <tld>, local mapping specified
# by <scheme> is performed on the name.  Otherwise no mapping are
# performed.  Multiple schemes can be specified; they are applied in
# turn.
#
# There are two special <tld>s for specifying a default mapping rule
# and a mapping rule for local names (domain names containing no
# dots).  If <tld> is `.', its schemes are applied to domain names
# whose TLD does not match any TLDs specified in local-map entries.
# If <tld> is `-', its schemes are applied to domain names which
# contain no dots.
