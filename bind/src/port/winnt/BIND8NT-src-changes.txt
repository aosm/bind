	Windows NT BIND 8.2.4 fixes:

Date:1-May-2001


  The following changes were made to BIND 8.2.4 to support the Windows NT
  build.  A few of the fixes were bugs in the generic code.  The rest are
  NT-specific.  No IP V6 testing has been done so it is not known if the
  NT version will listen on IP V6 sockets.
 
  A great deal of effort has gone into minimizing changes to non-Windows
  NT specific code, however, in a few places this was found to be necessary
  and macros have been used to #ifdef the code and provide generic
  style of content.

	There has not been a lot of testing of all of the features of
  BIND as I have limited resources. This will be up to the people
  installing this release to test.


LIBBIND:
Fixes for the accept error in socket.c.
Added proper error messaging in unistd.c.
Redirect fstat to use dll data space for file descriptor information.
General cleanup of the socket and unistd code.

NAMED-XFER
path-separator in named-xfer to get name into the event log without the path
name.

	If I have missed anything, please let me know.
