 package name: BIND 8.2.3 
   --------------

   - what is it?
     = Internet Software Consortium's BIND version 8.2.3 ported to CYGWIN.

   - system
     = CYGWIN running on WinTel.

   - Cygwin
     = for Cygwin version >= 1.18
 
   - preliminaries
     = Make SURE you have installed the latest version of CYGWIN, mounted binary/UNIX, otherwise the make files won't work.  There
       really should be no reason to run CYGWIN as DOS mounted.  If you need directories like that, you can create them and then
       mount them -t. See below about caveats.

     = If you want to build from vanilla source get the package named bind-src.tar.gz and
       it can be found at ftp.isc.org in the directory /isc/bind/src/8.2.3/ otherwise you can used the already patched
       source provided with this package.

     = In order for the make install to work correctly, you need user bin in group bin to exist.
       * NT/2000
         If you are running NT/2000, I recommend that you have your CYGWIN environment set to at least 'ntsec'.  Then, create
         a group in your NT user manager called 'cygwin_bin'.  NT4 does not allow user names with the same names as groups.  I
         don't know if this is the case for 2000, but I suspect that it is so.  Then, create a user named 'bin'.  Then go to the
         cygwin prompt, cd /etc, and save your passwd and group files.  Then, type mkgroup [-l | -d] >groups and edit this file.
         you will need to change the 'cygwin_bin' name to 'bin'.  Since this will have the same GID, this should hold for ntsec.
         Then, mkpasswd -l >passwd and edit passwd to make 'bin's home directory /bin.

         If I am wrong on any of this, please let me know.  It works for me!

       * 95/98
         I have not tested any of this on Windows 9x, so I am only guessing here that all you have to do is create entries in
         group and passwd files for 'bin'.  If there is anything else that needs to be done, please let me know.


   - configure, make, make install
     = create a directory named bind-8.2.3 (I did it under /usr/local/src but you don't have to if you have a
       better place.)

     = these example commands assume that you have downloaded the files into your home directory or '~'.  If not, please
       adjust the source directory names in the following command examples.

     = go to the directory and either:

     = unzip the already patched source with the command:
       $ tar xzf bind-8.2.3.CYGWIN.PATCHED.src.tar.gz

       --- or

     = unzip the vanilla source with the command:
       $ tar xzf bind-src.tar.gz

     = you should have a Makefile and a directory called "src".  If you have unzipped the already patched source, skip the next
       step.

     = apply the patch supplied with this package with the command:
       $ patch -p 1 < ~/bind-8.2.3.CYGWIN.patch

     = there is NO configure script supplied with bind-8.  cd into the src/ directory and execute 'make all' which should work
       flawlessly :)

     = if you have the proper bin/bin user/group set up you should be able to do 'make all install' and have a working bind.

     = When you need to link with this stuff (like for my apache port), you should add '-I/usr/local/bind/include' and
       '-L/usr/local/bind/lib' to the appropriate flags before making.

   - notes
	Everything is installed with the prefix /usr/local INCLUDING the "etc" path! See src/port/cygwin/Makefile.set and
	src/port/cygwin/port_before.h. /var stuff is under /var/local

	Make sure your path includes /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin.

	Also, this port MUST be compiled and run on CYGWIN ---BINARY--- mounted disks. Everything will break if this is not the
	case!  See the CYGWIN FAQ on how to do this.  Better yet, install or upgrade CYGWIN to mount everything binary from the
	beginning.

	I have NOT done any porting of the contrib package.

	The links for the contrib and docs are at http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind8.html as well as the above quoted link for
	the vanilla source code to apply the patch.

	Remember, this is freeware submitted under the GPL so I am not responsible for any problems resulting from any use of this
	port, whatsoever!  No warranty whatsoever is either expressed or implied in any way. What you see is what you get.

	I DO suggest that you get a good personal firewall if you are not already running one on your WinTel box.
	http://www.zonealarm.com  is a good place to start, or go to http://www.tucows.com and check out what they offer
	for downloadable firewalls.

	If there are any questions or problems, however, please feel free to email me.

	Happy Binding!
